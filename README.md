# US-Senate-Committees
A tableau story explaining diversity and the interconnected nature of Senate committees. Created by AJ Liberatore (liberatorea@wit.edu) and Jayden Butts (buttsj@wit.edu). This project had a focus on data collection and data visualization.

## Summary
**Instructions:** To view the Tableau story, download the provided .twbx file to your desired location on your pc. It is of note that in order to view the story and interactive dashboard themselves, a Tableau license is required.

## Data
The data we used was collected from two places. We used the [demographics and economy section of the Kaiser Family Foundation website](https://www.kff.org/state-category/demographics-and-the-economy/) for up to date US demographics, and we used the [US Senate website](https://www.senate.gov/reference/stats_and_lists.htm) to collect information about Senators and committees.

## Methods
Tools:
* Tableau 2020.3, to create dashboard and story points
* Gephi, to create network of committees
* VSCode, as code editor of choice
* MS Excel, to store node and edge data

Python Packages:
* Numpy, to uncover underlying stats
* Pandas, to store and clean data

## Discussion

## Future Work
With the base work set for the project, we have decided the following next steps would be appropriate:
* Add functionality as a website through utilization of open source web technology like React JS or similar frameworks
* Distribution of Senators by age compared to US population aged old enough to be Senators
* Developing charts displaying the relative influence of Senators, as well as further explaining how that was calculated
* Adding more professional flare to the project, elevating it to a level where we feel it is publishable as a website
